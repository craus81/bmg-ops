# FleetSuite books

FleetSuite is taking over the books from NetSuite: built hidden through the
end of 2026, run side by side with NetSuite for all of 2027, and the only
books from 2028-01-01 (owner decision 2026-10-09/10; the full plan is the
"Replacing NetSuite with FleetSuite" doc). It keeps two companies: BMG Fleet
Installations LLC and 1084 Cool Springs LLC, which owns the building.

This file covers part 1, the ledger core, and part 2, the chart of
accounts copied from NetSuite. The only screen is the accounts page at
`/admin/books`, which only super admins can open and nothing links to yet.

| Piece | Where |
| --- | --- |
| Companies, chart of accounts, months, journal | `migrations/359-books-ledger-core.sql` |
| Server helper (validate, post, reverse, close, reset) | `src/lib/books/journal.ts` |
| Database rule tests (PGlite) | `src/lib/books/ledger-core-sql.test.ts` |
| Account sync from NetSuite | `migrations/360-books-netsuite-accounts.sql`, `src/lib/books/netsuite-accounts.ts` |
| Account sync tests | `src/lib/books/netsuite-accounts.test.ts`, `src/lib/books/netsuite-accounts-sql.test.ts` |
| Accounts page and its API | `src/app/(main)/admin/books/page.tsx`, `src/app/api/admin/books/accounts/route.ts` |

The `ledger_*` tables from migration 314 are a different thing: copies of
QuickBooks and NetSuite history that importers replace wholesale. They stay
as they are. The books FleetSuite keeps itself live in `gl_*`.

## Rules the database enforces

These hold for any writer, including a direct insert with the service role.

- An entry has at least two lines and its debits equal its credits. This is
  checked when the posting transaction commits.
- Each line has an amount on exactly one side, above zero, in whole cents.
- A posted entry or line is never updated or deleted. To correct one,
  reverse it (`reverseEntry`) and post the right entry.
- Lines can only be added in the transaction that posts their entry.
- A reversal names the entry it reverses, in the same company
  (`gl_reverse_entry` posts them). An entry is reversed at most once, and a
  reversal is never reversed.
- A closed month refuses new entries. Closing and reopening are logged in
  `gl_period_events`, and reopening needs a reason. Each company has its own
  months.
- A typed entry (`source_type = 'manual'`) can't post to a control account
  (AR, AP, inventory). Only the documents behind those accounts post there.
- An account restricted to one company can't be used by the other. Once an
  account has postings, its type and company can't change.
- A heading (summary) account takes no postings.
- The same idempotency key never posts twice, so a retried post is safe.
- Until a company has `books_live_from` set, `resetJournal` empties the
  journal and its months for another rehearsal. Once any company is live,
  that is refused, the live date can't change, and entries dated before it
  are refused unless they are opening balances.

Only the service role can read or write the `gl_*` tables or call the
`gl_*` functions. RLS is on with no policies.

## Chart of accounts

Until the changeover NetSuite is the master for accounts (owner decision
2026-10-10). Accounts are added and changed in NetSuite, and FleetSuite
copies them every two hours, at the start of the ledger mirror cron
(`/api/cron/ledger-netsuite-mirror`, :35 on even hours). **Sync now** on the
accounts page runs the same job. Nothing is written back to NetSuite.

How a sync works (`syncBooksAccounts`, which hands the list to
`gl_sync_netsuite_accounts`):

- It reads every NetSuite account with SuiteQL, plus which subsidiaries
  each one is limited to (`AccountSubsidiaryMap`) and the subsidiaries
  themselves. Only the account list is required. Without the other two,
  accounts keep the company limits they had and the run says why.
- Accounts match on NetSuite's internal id (`netsuite_account_id`). New ones
  are added. Number, name, parent, inactive flag, description and company
  follow NetSuite.
- Non-posting and statistical accounts are left out. A NetSuite type this
  code doesn't know is left out and listed on the page, so it can be added
  to `NETSUITE_ACCOUNT_TYPES`.
- An account limited to one company's subsidiary belongs to that company.
  Anything else is open to both. A company with no subsidiary yet (1084) is
  linked the first time a sync finds exactly one active subsidiary with its
  name or number in it. A sync never changes an existing link.
- NetSuite's summary accounts come across as headings (`is_summary`), so the
  hierarchy holds.
- Once an account has postings, a type or company change from NetSuite is
  not applied. The account keeps a `sync_issue` and the run lists it.
- An account missing from a complete list is marked inactive with "No
  longer in NetSuite", unless the list looks cut short (empty, or under half
  of the active synced accounts). It comes back if NetSuite lists it again.
- One sync runs at a time, and the whole list applies in one transaction or
  not at all.

Each run is recorded in `sync_state` as `books_netsuite_accounts`, which the
accounts page shows. It is deliberately not a System Health monitor: the
books are hidden, and a monitor would alert every System Health admin.

If the integration role can't read `account` through SuiteQL, the page shows
NetSuite's refusal. The fix is then the role's permission, or a RESTlet mode
that lists the accounts.

At the changeover the sync is switched off, and accounts are kept in
FleetSuite from then on.

## Posting

```ts
import { createServiceClient } from '@/lib/supabase-service';
import { postEntry } from '@/lib/books/journal';

const posted = await postEntry(createServiceClient(), {
  company: 'BMG',
  entryDate: '2027-01-04',
  sourceType: 'invoice',
  sourceId: invoice.id,
  postingRule: 'invoice@1',
  idempotencyKey: `invoice:${invoice.id}:1`,
  postedBy: { id: profile.id, name: profile.full_name },
  lines: [
    { accountId: ar.id, debit: 1250, customerId: invoice.customer_id, jobRef: `so:${so.id}` },
    { accountId: sales.id, credit: 1250, division: 'upfit', location: 'ofallon' },
  ],
});
```

- `idempotencyKey` names the document, the rule and the generation. Posting
  the same key again returns `alreadyPosted: true` and writes nothing.
- `postingRule` carries a version (`invoice@1`), so a change to how a
  document posts can be traced.
- Amounts may be numbers or plain decimal strings. They go to the database
  as exact two-decimal strings.
- Errors are `BooksError`s. `kind` is `invalid` (caught before the
  database), `refused` (a database rule, such as a closed month) or
  `failed` (anything else).

## Closing a month

```ts
await setPeriodStatus(client, { company: 'BMG', month: '2027-01', status: 'closed', actor });
await setPeriodStatus(client, { company: 'BMG', month: '2027-01', status: 'open', actor, reason: 'Missed a vendor bill' });
```

A month opens the first time anything posts to it.

## Going live

1. Rehearse as often as needed: load, compare with NetSuite, `resetJournal`,
   repeat.
2. Set `gl_companies.books_live_from` (planned 2027-01-01). This can't be
   undone.
3. Post the opening balances dated the day before, with
   `source_type = 'opening_balance'`.
